# Dot Files and Home Folder Configuration

This bare repository serves as a backup for the Linux dot files and configuration of my home folder. It ensures that I have a copy of my personalized settings, customizations, and configurations in case I need to reinstall my OS or encounter any issues when fixing things that ain't broken... :P

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to local machine in the `/home/<myusername>`:

   ```
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/nad-garraz/dotfiles
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

   ```
   bash
   cd dot-files
   ```

3. Explore the various dot files and configuration files stored in the repository. These files typically include settings for your shell, text editor, window manager, and other applications.

4. Make any necessary modifications or customizations to the files based on your preferences.

5. Commit and push any changes to the repository to keep your backup up to date:

   ```
   bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update dot files"
   git push origin main
   ```
